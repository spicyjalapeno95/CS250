How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
   This is something that would go along the lines of customer service. In order to be able to understand the consumer and give them a successful product is to understand what they really want. Having a face to face meeting and learning who my customers are and
   asking what kind of things they are looking for would go a long way in helping to design a direction for a product. The user stories are a crucial part of this process as it allows broad ideas to be created and fine tuned as just re-reading what you put down
   will generate questions leading to how you would handle fine tuning these stories. 
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
   The first step to creating programs or anything I prepare to work on would be to create a very rough outline of what needs to be answered and the end goal. This helps me not lose track as I put extra focus on the finer details which will inevitably begin to fill
   in the blanks of that outline. I would greatly prefer to have a Scrum Master to Developer/Tester styled workplace. This seems to greatly increase the level of communication across the board as well as generate a team of workers that work as a whole instead of 
   relying heavily on individual accomplishments. The daily scrum meeting is a huge example of this. Another ideal concept is the sprints as this hyper focuses the priority that would ideally change as the product is developed allowing for more focused improvements. 
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
   A good team member in my opinion would be ones that are prepared for constructive criticism and being able to take responsibility. This is a field that does change as languages are improved or altered which means you have to be flexibile and want to continue to 
   learn and advance your knowledge. This would also come along with being able to accept that you don't know how to accomplish certain tasks and know how to reach out to the network of help to find those answers through other sources or peers. It will always take a 
   team to accomplish each product that is developed.
